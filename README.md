Work in progress Unity game. Player chooses what stories to cover and what headlines to make.


This project is a unity powered game created by students at Hawken Upper School. This is the debug/develper code and assets.

The game will be based upon player choices and they are given a set of news headlines each day and must choice which ones to cover. These actions will have consquences in the game, the job of the player is to maintain societal order and calm while maintaining a fan base, if he/she fails then society falls apart and riots ensue or he/she is fired. the game will be 2D with basic art.

Planning upon a headline generator, from a list of different words that can be arranged to form a feasible headline.
