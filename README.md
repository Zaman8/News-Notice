# News-Notice
Work in progress Unity game. Player chooses what stories to cover and what headlines to make.


This project is a unity powered game created by students at Hawken Upper School. This is the debug/develper code and assets.

The game will be based upon player choices and they are given a set of news headlines each day and must choice which ones to cover and their take on it (bad, neutral, good). These actions will have consquences in the game, the job of the player is to maintain societal order and calm, if he/she fails then society falls apart and riots ensue. the game will be 2D with basic art.
